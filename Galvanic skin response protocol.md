# Galvanic skin response protocol
### Setup
- Each electrode on the first and second fingers of the left hand, in between the second and third joint
- GSR signals can be viewed under the ‘Auxiliary Sensors’ tab in ActiView

- Requires CMS/DRL ground electrodes and GRS electrodes (only available for Mobile EEG system)
- Have participants wash and dry their hands prior to attaching electrodes
- Position each electrode on the first and second fingers of the left hand, in between the second and third joint
- Use the larger adhesive rings to maximise contact with the skin
- CMS/DRL electrodes can be placed on the upper arm if they are not being used to measure ECG
- GSR signals can be viewed under the ‘Auxiliary Sensors’ tab in ActiView
- Adjust the scale to ~100mV or ~200mV if necessary 
- Make sure to check ‘Add displayed sensors’ when saving the data
- An adaptation period of at least 10 minutes is strongly advised

SCL was measured using two passive Nihon Kohden electrodes interfaced with the BioSemi ActiveTwo system. These electrodes were attached to the volar surfaces of the intermediate phalanges of the left hand. EBR was measured using two amplified adhesive Ag/AgCl EEG electrodes attached laterally and just below the left eye, also interfaced with the BioSemi ActiveTwo system. This oscillated at 16Hz, synchronised with the EEG sampling rate of the EEG system.

### Triggers

**If using a parallel port to send triggers**
- Check LTP port (via ‘Device Manager’)
- Check the range: the first value here should be the address when setting up io32
